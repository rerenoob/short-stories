# Nala, the genius

Nala lives with his mom in a small house in the city. He likes to eat Pho with
his mom in the morning. In the afternoon, he likes to go play in the playground
where he can climb up and down the rock-climbing wall. 

# Iila, the princess

Iila lives in a big house, which she calls a kingdom. Her parents treats her
like a princess. She is friend with Nala and they some times have tea party
together.

# Asip, the old neighbor

Asip lives on the same block with Nala and Iila. His front lawn has the best
grass in the neighborhood so children likes to come and play. He enjoys the
sight of small children because his children are all grown up and away from
home.
