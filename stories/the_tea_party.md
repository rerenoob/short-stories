# Tea Party, Please!

On day, Iila invited Nala to her tea party. She prepares the table with all kind
of delicious food, like cookies and macaroons. Mr. Teddy Bear is also at the
table. Nala sits at one of the chairs and he really enjoys one of the cookies. He
asks:

_Nala_: Iila, these cookies are really yummy. Can I have another one?

_Iila_: Nala, you can, only if you ask nicely.

_Nala_: Okay. Can I have another cookie, please?

_Iila_: Yes, here you go.

Iila hands Nala another cookie, which he eats in only 2 bites. They spend the
afternoon drinking tea and eating sweets with Mr. Teddy Bear.
