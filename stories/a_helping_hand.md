One sunny afternoon, Nala and Iila are playing on Asip's front yard with a few
other children. Nala has a dump truck and a shovel, which he uses to fill the
truck with sand. Iila has her tea cups and is having tea with her dolls.

Mr. Asip walks buy holding a few grocery bags on both hands. As he walks by, he
says hi to the children. Suddenly, his grocery bag tears up and a few apples
fall down and roll around the grass where Nala and Iila are playing. Seeing
that, Iila turns to Nala and whisper:

_Iila_: Oh no, his grocery is every where.<br/> 
_Nala_: Mr. Asip will need help picking up all the apples, I think. <br/> 
_Iila_: I think we should help him. We can continue our play after.<br/> 
_Nala_: Okay, let's help him!<br/>

Iila and Nala stand up and collect all the apples and bring it to Mr. Asip, who
is trying to fit the apples in another bag. As they hand over the apples, Mr.
Asip looks at them and says:

_Mr. Asip_: Thank you for helping me picking up the apples.<br/>
_Iila and Nala_: You are welcome!.<br/>
_Mr. Asip_: Would you like an apple?<br/>
_Nala_: Sure! Thank you!<br/>

Mr. Asip hands Nala an apple from the bag. Nala is excited to have it, and he
shares it with Iila. Both return to their plays while enjoying the fruity treat.
