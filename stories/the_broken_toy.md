# The Broken Toy

Nala loves playing with trucks and cars. His favorite truck is a mail truck that
is white and looks like the mailman's truck. Its doors can be opened and closed.
When he pulls it back and lets go, the truck speeds up and runs across the room.

One day, Iila comes over to play with Nala. She accidentally steps on the mail
truck and breaks one of its door. Oh no! She says. Nala is visibly upset.

_Iila_: I am sorry. I didn't see the truck.<br/>
_Nala_: It is my favorite truck. The door fell off because you stepped on it.
<br/>
_Iila_: It is a nice truck. I am sorry I broke it. Can you fix it?<br />
_Nala_: Hmm let's see. It looks like we can just snap the door back in.<br/>
_Iila_: Let's try that! I can help.<br/>
_Nala_: Okay, you hold the truck, and I can try to put the door back.<br/>

With the help of Iila, Nala snaps the door back on the truck. They are jumping
with joy. Iila is now more careful and watches her steps so she doesn't step on
Nala's toys. Nala learns a new skill that he can fix broken toys with help of a
friend. They spend the afternoon racing cars and laugh together.
