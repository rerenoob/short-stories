Nala and Iila go to the playground and play with other children. The two friends
are having a good time going down the slide. While running over to the seesaw,
Nala trips and falls down on a puddle. His shirt gets very dirty with mud.

Other children see that and laugh at him. Iila comes over quickly, holds out a
hand:

_Iila_: Are you okay? Here, hold my hand and get up.
_Nala_: Ouch, it hurts. Now my shirt is dirty and other children laugh at me.
_Iila_: It's okay. You can ask your mommy to wash it later. 
_Nala_: You're right. My mommy always clean everything up. No need to worry!
_Iila_: Do you want to play the seesaw, Nala?
_Nala_: Sure thing!

Even with the dirty shirt, Nala and Iila enjoy playing on the seesaw and laugh
together. Friends help each others get up after they fall down, and Iila does
just that.
